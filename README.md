## Introduction ##

FSet is a functional set-theoretic collections library.  _Functional_ means that all
update operations return a new collection rather than modifying an existing one in
place.  _Set-theoretic_ means that collections may be nested arbitrarily with no
additional programmer effort; for instance, sets may contain sets, maps may be keyed
by sets, etc.

The [FSet home
page](https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/fset/fset/-/wikis/home) has an
introduction and tutorial.

There might be some useful information on the [FSet CLiki page](http://cliki.net/FSet).
