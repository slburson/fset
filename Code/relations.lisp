;;; ================================================================================
;;; List relations

;;; A list relation is a general relation (i.e. of arbitrary arity >= 2) whose tuples are
;;; in list form.  List relations support a `query' operation that takes, along with the
;;; relation, a list, of length equal to the arity, called the "pattern".  For each
;;; position, if the pattern contains the symbol `fset:?', the query is not constrained
;;; by that position; otherwise, the result set contains only those tuples with the same
;;; value in that position as the pattern has.  There is also a `query-multi' operation
;;; that is similar, but the pattern contains sets of possible values (or `?') in each
;;; position, and the result set contains all tuples with any of those values in that
;;; position.

#||

Okay, this is a start, but:

() Don't we want to do better meta-indexing, so adding a tuple doesn't require
iterating through all the indices?  [Eh, maybe not]

() I'm not creating composite indices yet.  The plan is straightforward -- create
one when the size of the final result set is <= the square root of the size of
the smallest index set.  This is easy, but how do subsequent queries find the
composite index?  [Why "square root"?  Maybe a fixed fraction like 1/8?]
