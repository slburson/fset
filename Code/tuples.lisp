;;; Dynamic Tuples

;;; Tuples are abstractly similar to maps, at least in an untyped language like
;;; Lisp, but have a very different usage profile.  The big difference is that
;;; the key set is bounded, and indeed normally fixed at compile time.  Tuple
;;; keys are analogous to slots of classes; they're not arbitrary values created
;;; at runtime.  In Lisp it is natural to associate them with symbols.  Also,
;;; tuple key comparisons are always done with `eq', not `equal?' as for maps.
;;; So they're really more like structs than maps, except that (a) update is
;;; functional (of course) and (b) there's only one tuple type; any key can be
;;; added to any tuple, yet the representation is sparse: any given tuple takes
;;; only space proportional to the number of pairs it actually contains.

;;; Here is an example of a situation in which the use of tuples is appropriate
;;; -- indeed, highly recommended.  Suppose you have instances of a mutable
;;; class, and you want to create a map mapping those instances to some range
;;; type, but rather than the mapping being by identity, you want it to be by
;;; some part of the content of the instances.  You might be inclined to define
;;; a `compare' method on this class that compares the instances by comparing
;;; an appropriate subset of their attributes.  But there's a danger here.  If
;;; any of the values of those attributes ever changes after the instance has
;;; been used as a map key, the instance will, in general, no longer compare the
;;; same way against the other instances in the map, thus blowing one of the key
;;; invariants of the map's internal structure and rendering it more or less
;;; useless.

;;; What you should do instead is, for each instance used as a key in this map,
;;; make a tuple containing the values of the attributes in question, and then
;;; use the tuple as the map key.  If you attach the tuple to the instance by a
;;; new attribute, then the object can always know what tuple it has been
;;; indexed by in the map; and if the values in that tuple differ, at some 
;;; point, from those in the instance, then you know that the instance values
;;; have changed since the instance was last indexed in the map, and you have
;;; all the information handy to re-index the instance (removing the old
;;; mapping, constructing the new tuple, and then adding the new mapping).

;;; It's true, you could use a list or short vector instead, and for very small
;;; tuples you may as well do so.  But for larger tuples and particularly those
;;; with sparse slots (at which most of the tuples created have no assigned
;;; value), you may find the additional functionality of these tuples useful.

;;; Keys can be defined with `define-tuple-key', or obtained at runtime with
;;; `get-tuple-key'.

;;; The implementation gets its speed by arranging for lookup to be done by
;;; scanning consecutive memory locations (thus taking advantage of cache
;;; effects) rather than by ordered trees.  Thus the performance characteristics
;;; of tuples are quite different from those of the other FSet classes; where the
;;; other FSet classes do lookups in log time but with a significant constant
;;; factor, tuple lookups use linear search but with a very small constant factor
;;; -- making them faster than even a well-compiled `assoc'.  This is partly
;;; because of better use of the cache, and partly because of a clever scheme for
;;; thread-safe dynamic reordering that makes frequently used slots cheaper to
;;; access.

;;; A tuple is implemented as a struct of (a) a descriptor and (b) a vector of
;;; bounded-length "chunk" vectors, the latter containing the values.  Each
;;; descriptor is in general shared by many tuple instances with the same key set;
;;; it has a key vector, which contains two copies of a sequence of pairs
;;; represented as fixnums with two fields; one member of the pair is the key
;;; number, the other is the index of the value.  Lookup scans the sequence to
;;; find the given key number, then uses the index as an address within the chain
;;; of value vectors.  Notice that the index within the key vector at which a
;;; given pair is found is immaterial.

;;; The reason the key vectors contain two copies of the sequence is to give us
;;; thread-safe dynamic reordering without locking lookups.  If one thread is in
;;; the middle of a reordering and another simultaneously does a lookup on a tuple
;;; that uses the same key vector, the worst that can happen is that it will miss
;;; the entry in the first copy of the sequence (which is the one that gets
;;; reordered) and find it in the second copy.

;;; So as not to reorder on every lookup we define a "window" -- the first few
;;; slots of the key vector; the exact size depends on the number of keys -- and
;;; arrange that if a key is found within the window, no reordering takes place.
;;; If a lookup finds the key entry outside the window, however, it exchanges its
;;; position with the previous entry (unless the previous entry is in the window,
;;; in which case a slot in the window is selected pseudorandomly for eviction).

;;; The reason the values are broken up into chunks is to keep update of large
;;; tuples from getting too slow.  I don't really expect there to be many cases
;;; where tuples get larger than a chunk or two, but they could occasionally.

;;; Note that there is the potential for exponential size blowup if a large
;;; number of keys are used in many different orders, since every set of keys
;;; ever used is represented explicitly, and in the worst case this would be
;;; the powerset of the set of keys.  I don't think real code behaves this way,
;;; but it's something to keep in mind.
